              As a mathematician and computer scientist, I worked three years as Postdoc at the Institute for Operations Research at ETH Z체rich. 
              I was in the lead of two industry collaborations:
              * With the Swiss Post, we optimized the tours for same-day delivery in Zurich and other Swiss cities using local-search-based meta-heuristics.
              * For the Swiss Federal Railways SBB, I developed a high performance algorithm for optimal rolling stock scheduling.

              Furthermore, my reasearch included
              * Nash flows over time (agent-based traffic modeling)
              * design and implementation of a fast clustering algorithm
              * research in efficient algorithms, meta-heuristics, parallelism, and operations research

        - title: Research Associate in Discrete Mathematics
