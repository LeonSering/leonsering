I am a mathematician and computer scientist developing routing algorithms for MOIA. In addition to my theoretical research on Nash flows over time (agent-based traffic modeling), I have a strong passion for fast optimization algorithms.

My programming language of choice? Rust. This high-performance systems programming language, with its focus on fearless concurrency, is the perfect tool for my projects. And most importantly: it’s fun to use!

In my downtime, you’ll find me with my family, exploring the wonders of the world through road trips, photography, and scuba diving.

## Welcome to my website!

Here, I showcase my [projects](#projects), my [scientific work](#publications), and our [travel adventures](#traveling).
