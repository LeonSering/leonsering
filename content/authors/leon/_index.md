As a mathematician and computer scientist, I currently work as a Postdoc for the [Institute for Operations Research](https://math.ethz.ch/ifor) at ETH Zurich.
Beside my theoretical research on [Nash flows over time](/publication/sering-2020-diss) (agent-based traffic modelling), my true passion lies in optimization algorithms and high performance algorithm design.

I lead two exciting industry collaborations:

- With the Swiss Post, we optimize the tours for [same-day delivery](/project/vehicle_routing) in Zurich and other Swiss Cities using local-search-based meta-heuristics.

- For the Swiss Federal Railways SBB, I'm developing a high performance algorithm for optimal [rolling stock scheduling](/project/rolling_stock_scheduling).

My programming language of choice? **Rust**.
This high performance system programming language, with focus on concurrency, is the perfect tool for my projects.
Plus, it's just plain fun to use!

In my downtime, you will find me exploring the world together with my family -- through road trips, photography, and Scuba diving.

## Welcome to my website!
Here, I showcase my [project](/#projects), my [scientific work](/#publications), and our incredible [travel adventures](/#travelling).
