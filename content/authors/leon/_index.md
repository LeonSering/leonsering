I am mathematician and computer scientist with a real passion for operations research, combinatorial optimization, and high-performance algorithm design.
As a PostDoc at the institute of operations research at ETH Zürich, I am currently in the lead of several industry-collaborations in the area of vehicle routing and scheduling.

Most importantly, I am a curious person and therefore I am always eager to learn new skills and to dig deep into a new challenging topic. In recent times I became very enthusiastic about the programming language Rust, which has sparked an entirely new passion for programming within me.
