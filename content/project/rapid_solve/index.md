During my time at ETH ZÃ¼rich, I gained extensive experience in solving optimization problems using
local search-based meta-heuristics. What started as a hobby project evolved into a Rust library
called [RapidSolve](https://docs.rs/rapid_solve), which provides a framework for implementing
multiple meta-heuristics to tackle combinatorial optimization problems. Over time, I developed and
integrated the following algorithms into the library:

- [(Parallel/recursive) local search](https://docs.rs/rapid_solve/latest/rapid_solve/heuristics/local_search)
- [Threshold accepting](https://docs.rs/rapid_solve/latest/rapid_solve/heuristics/threshold_accepting)
- [Simulated annealing](https://docs.rs/rapid_solve/latest/rapid_solve/heuristics/simulated_annealing)
- [(Parallel) tabu search](https://docs.rs/rapid_solve/latest/rapid_solve/heuristics/tabu_search)

The library is designed to be highly extensible, and I plan to incorporate additional algorithms in
the future.

One of RapidSolve's standout features is its support for hierarchical objectives, allowing the
meta-heuristics to address problems in multiple stages automatically. For example, if the primary
objective is to minimize a violation penalty, the meta-heuristic first seeks a feasible solution
(eliminating violations) before optimizing the remaining objectives.

Before releasing the library on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rapid_solve),
I added comprehensive documentation including example code demonstrating how to
apply every supported meta-heuristics to the classic
[traveling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).
