abstract: In an atomic splittable flow over time game, finitely many players route
  flow dynamically through a network, in which edges are equipped with transit times,
  specifying the traversing time, and with capacities, restricting flow rates. Infinitesimally
  small flow particles controlled by the same player arrive at a constant rate at
  the player's origin and the player's goal is to maximize the flow volume that arrives
  at the player's destination within a given time horizon. Hereby, the flow dynamics
  described by the deterministic queuing model, i.e., flow of different players merges
  perfectly, but excessive flow has to wait in a queue in front of the bottle-neck.
  In order to determine Nash equilibria in such games, the main challenge is to consider
  suitable definitions for the players' strategies, which depend on the level of information
  the players receive throughout the game. For the most restricted version, in which
  the players receive no information on the network state at all, we can show that
  there is no Nash equilibrium in general, not even for networks with only two edges.
  However, if the current edge congestions are provided over time, the players can
  adopt their route choices dynamically. We show that a profile of those strategies
  always lead to a unique feasible flow over time. Hence, those atomic splittable
  flow over time games are well-defined. For parallel-edge networks Nash equilibria
  exists and the total flow arriving in time equals the value of a maximum flow over
  time leading to a price of anarchy of 1.
