abstract: 'The flip graph of triangulations has as vertices all triangulations of
  a convex n-gon, and an edge between any two triangulations that differ in exactly
  one edge. An r-rainbow cycle in this graph is a cycle in which every inner edge
  of the triangulation appears exactly r times. This notion of a rainbow cycle extends
  in a natural way to other flip graphs. In this paper we investigate the existence
  of r-rainbow cycles for three different flip graphs on classes of geometric objects:
  the aforementioned flip graph of triangulations of a convex n-gon, the flip graph
  of plane trees on an arbitrary set of n points, and the flip graph of non-crossing
  perfect matchings on a set of n points in convex position. In addition, we consider
  two flip graphs on classes of non-geometric objects: the flip graph of permutations
  of 1,2,…,n and the flip graph of k-element subsets of 1,2,…,n. In each of the five
  settings, we prove the existence and non-existence of rainbow cycles for different
  values of r, n and k.'
