abstract: '<p align="justify">We study dynamic network flows and introduce a notion of instantaneous
  dynamic equilibrium (IDE) requiring that for any positive inflow into an edge, this
  edge must lie on a currently shortest path towards the respective sink. We measure
  current shortest path length by current waiting times in queues plus physical travel
  times. As our main results, we show: 1. existence and constructive computation of
  IDE flows for single-source single-sink networks assuming constant network inflow
  rates, 2. finite termination of IDE flows for multi-source single-sink networks
  assuming bounded and finitely lasting inflow rates, 3. the existence of IDE flows
  for multi-source multi-sink instances assuming general measurable network inflow
  rates, 4. the existence of a complex single-source multi-sink instance in which
  any IDE flow is caught in cycles and flow remains forever in the network.</p>'
