abstract: Flows over time enable a mathematical modeling of traffic that changes as
  time progresses. In order to evaluate these dynamic flows from a game theoretical
  perspective we consider the price of anarchy (PoA). In this paper we study the impact
  of spillback effects on the PoA, which turn out to be substantial. It is known that,
  in general, the PoA is unbounded in the spillback setting. We extend this by showing
  that it is still unbounded even when considering networks with unit edge capacities
  and that the Braess ratio can be arbitrarily large. In contrast to that, we show
  that on a fixed network the PoA as a function of the flow amount is bounded by a
  constant and also upper bound the PoA for the set of networks where the outflow
  capacities satisfy certain constraints depending on the quickest flow. This upper
  bound only depends on the worst spillback factor of the Nash flows over time of
  the given network. It therefore provides a way to quantify the impact of spillback
  to the quality of the dynamic equilibria. In addition, we show the surprising fact
  that the introduction of spillback behavior can actually speed up dynamic equilibria
  in some networks.
