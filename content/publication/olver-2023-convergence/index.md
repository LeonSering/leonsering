abstract: <p align="justify">We consider a dynamic model of traffic that has received a lot of attention
  in the past few years. Infinitesimally small agents aim to travel from a source
  to a destination as quickly as possible. Flow patterns vary over time, and congestion
  effects are modeled via queues, which form based on the deterministic queueing model
  whenever the inflow into a link exceeds its capacity.Are equilibria in this model
  meaningful as a prediction of traffic behavior? For this to be the case, a certain
  notion of stability under ongoing perturbations is needed. Real traffic consists
  of discrete, atomic “packets”, rather than being a continuous flow of non-atomic
  agents. Users may not choose an absolutely quickest route available, if there are
  multiple routes with very similar travel times. We would hope that in both these
  situations - a discrete packet model, with packet size going to 0, and {{< math >}}$\varepsilon${{< /math >}}-equilibria,
  with {{< math >}}$\varepsilon${{< /math >}} - going to 0 - equilibria converge to dynamic equilibria in the flow over
  time model. No such convergence results were known.We show that such a convergence
  result does hold in single-commodity instances for both of these settings, in a
  unified way. More precisely, we introduce a notion of “strict” {{< math >}}$\varepsilon${{< /math >}}-equilibria, and
  show that these must converge to the exact dynamic equilibrium in the limit as {{< math >}}$\varepsilon \to 0${{< /math >}}.
  We then show that results for the two settings mentioned can be deduced from this
  with only moderate further technical effort.</p>
