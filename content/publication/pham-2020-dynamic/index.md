abstract: Predicting selfish behavior in public environments by considering Nash equilibria
  is a central concept of game theory. For the dynamic traffic assignment problem
  modeled by a flow over time game, in which every particle tries to reach its destination
  as fast as possible, the dynamic equilibria are called Nash flows over time. So
  far, this model has only been considered for networks in which each arc is equipped
  with a constant capacity, limiting the outflow rate, and with a transit time, determining
  the time it takes for a particle to traverse the arc. However, real-world traffic
  networks can be affected by temporal changes, for example, caused by construction
  works or special speed zones during some time period. To model these traffic scenarios
  appropriately, we extend the flow over time model by time-dependent capacities and
  time-dependent transit times. Our first main result is the characterization of the
  structure of Nash flows over time. Similar to the static-network model, the strategies
  of the particles in dynamic equilibria can be characterized by specific static flows,
  called thin flows with resetting. The second main result is the existence of Nash
  flows over time, which we show in a constructive manner by extending a flow over
  time step by step by these thin flows.
