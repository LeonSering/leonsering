abstract: Damian et al. [2] introduced an intuitive type of transformations between
  simple polygons on a finite set of points in the plane. Each transformation consists
  of a sequence of atomic modifications of two types, called stretches and twangs.
  They proved that, for a given set of n points, the space of these simple polygons
  is connected by {{< math >}}$O(n^2)${{< /math >}} such transformations. We solve an open question of Damian
  et al. concerning a combinatorial upper bound on the length of these sequences.
  To this end, we show that the length of a twang cascade is bounded by {{< math >}}$n^3/2${{< /math >}}.
