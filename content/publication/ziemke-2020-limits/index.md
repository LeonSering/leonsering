abstract: <p align="justify">This study examines the connection between an agent-based transport simulation
  and Nash flows over time. While the former is able to represent many details of
  traffic and model large-scale, real-world traffic situations with a co-evolutionary
  approach, the latter provides an environment for provable mathematical statements
  and results on exact user equilibria. The flow dynamics of both models are very
  similar with the main difference that the simulation is discrete in terms of vehicles
  and time while the flows over time model considers continuous flows and continuous
  time. This raises the question whether Nash flows over time are the limit of the
  convergence process when decreasing the vehicle and time step size in the simulation
  coherently. The experiments presented in this study indicate this strong connection
  which provides a justification for the analytical model and a theoretical foundation
  for the simulation.</p>
