abstract: We study the long-term behavior of dynamic traffic equilibria and find that
  it heavily depends on whether spillback is captured in the traffic model or not.
  We give an example where no steady state is reached. Although the example consists
  of a single-commodity instance with constant inflow rate, the Nash flow over time
  consists of infinitely many phases. This is in contrast to what has been proven
  for Nash flows over time without spillback [[Cominetti et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2020.2081); [Olver et
  al., 2021](../olver-2022-continuity)]. Additionally, we show that similar phase oscillations as in the Nash
  flow over time with spillback can be observed in the co-evolutionary transport simulation
  MATSim. This reaffirms the robustness of the findings as the simulation does (in
  contrast to Nash flows over time) not lead to exact user equilibra and, moreover,
  models discrete time steps and vehicles.
