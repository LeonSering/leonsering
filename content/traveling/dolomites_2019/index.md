        During our 4-day hiking adventure in the Sexten Dolomites, my girlfriend and I traversed the
        Elferscharte, a breathtaking high route, to reach the Zsigmondyhütte. Continuing our journey, we circled the iconic
        Drei Zinnen (German for 'Three Merlons') and concluded the trek with a thrilling hike to the beautiful Misurina Lake.
