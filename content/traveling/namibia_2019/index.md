        Navigating through Namibia and Botswana, my girlfriend and I kicked off our journey in Windhoek,
        renting a typical white Toyota Hilux with a rooftop tent. We made stops at the stunning landscapes of Fish River
        Canyon and the beautiful Sossusvlei. The highlight was undoubtedly Etosha National Park, where we were treated to
        remarkable wildlife encounters, including sightings of elephants, rhinos, giraffes, leopards, and lions. Continuing
        our exploration, we witnessed the breathtaking Victoria Falls before delving into the peaceful ambience of the
        Okavango Delta through an unforgettable mokoro trip.
